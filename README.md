# HUMAN-FOLLOWER-ON-RASPBERRY-PI
To perform object tracking on Raspberry Pi in real-time using a 4-wheel robot


Robot detects an object using a Machine Learning model 'MobileNet SSD v1 (COCO)' and TensorFlow Lite interpreter. The Robot follows the object and manoeuvres itself to get the object in the center of frame. While the robot is tracking / following the object, working of tracking algorithm and Robot's view can be accessed on a browser. Robot's view with information overlay is generated using OpenCV. The various overlays on a frame are shown in the picture below
